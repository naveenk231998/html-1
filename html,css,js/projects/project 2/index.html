                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Born on 28 September 1907 in Lyallpur, western Punjab, India (present-day Pakistan) in a Sikh
                        family, Bhagat Singh was the second son of Kishan Singh Sandhu and Vidya Vati. His grandfather
                        Arjan Singh, father Kishan Singh and uncle Ajit Singh were actively involved in the Indian
                        independence movement.</li>
                    <li>when Bhagat Singh was born, his father and two uncles were behind bars for taking part in the
                        agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907. </li>
                    <li>After studying in a village school for a couple of years, he attended an Anglo-Vedic school in
                        Lahore, operated by Arya Samaj. In 1923, he was admitted to the National College in Lahore which
                        was founded by the Indian Independence activist Lala Lajpat Rai. </li>
                    <li>Simon Commission was established by the British Government to report the political situation in
                        India. The Commission headed by Sir John Simon was boycotted as no Indian was a part of it.
                    </li>
                    <li>On 30 October 1928, the Commission visited Lahore. Lala Lajpat Rai led a silent march against
                        it. In a bid to disperse the demonstrators, the Superintendent of Police, James A. Scott,
                        ordered a lathi charge in which Rai was grievously injured. Rai died of a heart attack on 17
                        November 1928. </li>

                    <li>Singh along with other prisoners underwent a hunger strike. Failed attempts were made to break
                        the strike by the government. With the nationwide popularity of the hunger strike, the
                        government decided to advance the Lahore Conspiracy Case Singh was transported to Bostal Jail in
                        Lahore and the trial began on 10 July 1929. </li>

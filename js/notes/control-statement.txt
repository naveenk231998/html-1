control statement control flow ofn document using some condtions.
usually they wirten true or false

simple if:
only if statement will be there if (condtion)
{
    //code
}
code will be excuted incase condtion fails
if{
    //code
}
else
P{

    //code
}
code will be excuted only if condtion is true , else code 2 wil be excuted 

if else if 
you check multiple condtion by if -else if ladder 
if(condtion)
code1
else if(codtion2)
code2
else
code3

if condtion is true code1 wil be excuted if statement else it will be excuted else 










==================================
switch
==================================
switch works in the place of nested if.
switch contains cases and default. if switch expression mathches any case and that case will be excuted , if it dosent match, then default will be excuted .

every switch statement will have break elase code of next case will also be excute untill program finss break or switch is over.

this error is called 'fall through"
error
x=1
switch(x)
{
    case
}
